# diarry
A web application serving as your personal diary.

This is a project I started for the sake of learning Rust and React.js. Needless to say, it's not that good (a mess really) and probably has a fair amount of bugs in it.

Regardless, the idea is to have this app be deployed externally with your unique credentials, giving you access to it from every device that has internet.

This is still a work in progress and a tutorial for deployment will come once it's ready.

# TODO:
HTML/CSS re-design. Current design is atrocious. Needs a custom layout which is not full of hacks like the current one.
